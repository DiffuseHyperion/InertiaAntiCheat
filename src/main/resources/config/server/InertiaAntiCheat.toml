[transfer]
# The method clients should use in transfering their modlist to the server.
# "data" will have clients send the entirety of each mod in their mod list. This is the most secure.
# "name" will have clients send the file name of each mod in their mod list. This is the fastest.
# "id" will have clients send the id of each mod in their mod list. This is a good compromise.
# Use "name" if you are using large modpacks to make login times reasonable.
# Accepted types: "data", "name", "id"
method = "data"

[validation]
# The method to check client's mod list.
# If you prefer blacklisting/whitelisting certain mods from being used, use "individual".
